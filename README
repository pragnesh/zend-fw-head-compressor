======

Dm library contains View Helpers: compressScript and compressStyle, which provide you possibility
to pack all head files to minifyed one for reducing number of HTTP requests. For using it you don't have
to change your application code, just change lines with adding head scripts and styles in
main layout, so it's rather easy to use this not only for new, but even for already worked projects.

INTRODUCTION
=====================

Prototype for this helper comes from here
http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/zend_framework/85324/

But there were some great problems with given code:
    - no testing facilities cause of using $_SERVER array
    - hard to change rules for folders mapping when additional domains/CDN are used
    - several bags with static variables using
    - many code repeats
    - etc...
So, I rewrite full code of this helper to make it more flexible and stable,
but great thanks previous author for idea and first steps!

LISENCE
=====================

Don't know exactly, will wait for you help/advice in this question.

USING HELPERS
=====================

For reusing this library in your application do next:

1. Copy directories library/Dm/*, library/Tools/* to you libraries directory

2. Add following lines to application.ini file (or do the same configuration via Bootstrap):

;; Set autoloading for DM library
autoloaderNamespaces[] = "Dm"

;; Add new path for finding view helpers
resources.view.helperPath.CP_View_Helper = APPLICATION_PATH "/../library/Dm/View/Helper"

3. Create folder for handling cached JS and CSS files. This folder should be available for webserver,
follow directories will be used as default: 
- public/cache/js for scripts
- public/cache/css for styles

Give this directories 0777 permissions.

JAVASCRIPT PROCESSING
=====================

4. If you already use headScript() view helper for adding JS files on HTML page, pass this step.
In other case, start to do this. Any way you have to get something like this:

<?php $this->headScript()->appendFile($this->baseUrl('js/jquery.js')); ?>
<?php $this->headScript()->appendFile($this->baseUrl('js/jquery.prettyPhoto.js')); ?>

No matter where you have done this: in controller, view script or in layout.
You can find more information on headScript() helper here:
http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.headscript

5. To append link to compressed JS files to head section, add follow line between <head></head> tags:

<?php echo $this->compressScript() ?>

CSS STYLES PROCESSING
=====================

6. The same with css files appending:

<?php $this->headLink()->appendStylesheet($this->baseUrl('styles/style.css')); ?>
<?php $this->headLink()->appendStylesheet($this->baseUrl('styles/jquery.prettyPhoto.css')); ?>

And than

<?php echo $this->compressStyle() ?>

ADDITIONAL NOTES
=====================

For making your site faster, you can compress this files using gzip and set server headers for client caching.
This helpers don't gzip content of cache files cause of several problems with this in some browsers.
But you can easy add gzipping on your web server, according to client-side request.

For Apache, you can use this configuration:

=====================
# css, js gzip compression
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/javascript
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript

# max compression
DeflateCompressionLevel 9
DeflateWindowSize 15
DeflateBufferSize 32768

# Expires, static content will be cached on client side for 10 year
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault "access plus 10 years"

<FilesMatch \.(html|xhtml|xml|shtml|phtml|php)$>
    ExpiresActive Off
</FilesMatch>

# ETag for images, js, css
FileETag none
<FilesMatch \.(js|css|gif|png|jpg|swf)$>
    FileETag MTime Size
</FilesMatch>
=====================

For Nginx, use this:

=====================
gzip on;

# For using gzip_static module you have to configure nginx with special key
# to get more information on this, pls, don't hesitate to use google
gzip_static on;
gzip_http_version 1.1;
gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";
gzip_types text/plain text/html text/css application/x-javascript text/javascript;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_comp_level 9;
gzip_proxied any;
=====================

For other web servers you can quickly find information in Internet.
